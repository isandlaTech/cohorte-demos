COHORTE PLATFORM
1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
dev


26 Nov 2014 :
-------------

BUG FIX :
  - Fixing the problem of lost STDIN.
  - Fixing the problem of the dirty stop of nodes.

NEW FEATURES :
  - adding "--use-cache" (experimental) option to the startup script "run". If set to "true", a cache file of the repository is created and used next startup time to accelerate the loading time (ATTENTION: limited support! only python nodes).

ENHANCEMENT :
  - clean-up directory structure (build artifacts are now in 'build' folder and there is no base template)
  - small COHORTE logo at startup
